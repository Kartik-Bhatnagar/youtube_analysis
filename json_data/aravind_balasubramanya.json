How to ensure maximum nourishment and purity when we eat?Meet Aryan and Goutham, the twins whose similarities end with their looks. However, their different perspectives about life bring us many insights. In this episode, we learn why the food prayer is not some religious rite but a practical and easy method for good nutrition in every sense. It is based on wisdom that Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba shared in many public and private discourses."

May 6th is celebrated as Easwaramma Day and Children's Day every year. Why do we celebrate a day when Mother Easwaramma died? The answer has been provided by Swami Himself through the narration of the poignant episode on May 6th 1972. Two points come out strongly from her life:\n1. The Mother was foremost among devotees.\n2. The Lord is ready to become a 'son' for His devotee. \n\nWishing everyone a happy and holy Mothers Day. Hope you enjoy this talk which was originally delivered to the SSE Gurus and Students of the Sathya Sai Baba Center of Cooksville in Canada.",

                    "description": "Mother Easwaramma shouldered the unique 'opportunity' and 'burden' of being mother to Sri Sathya Sai Baba. May 6th is celebrated as Easwaramma Day and Children's Day every year. Why do we celebrate a day when Mother Easwaramma died? The answer has been provided by Swami Himself through the narration of the poignant episode on May 6th 1972. Two points come out strongly from her life:\n1. The Mother was foremost among devotees.\n2. The Lord is ready to become a 'son' for His devotee. \n\nWishing everyone a happy and holy Mothers Day. Hope you enjoy this talk which was originally delivered to the SSE Gurus and Students of the Sathya Sai Baba Center of Cooksville in Canada."

So how can you give to Me what I already have but your love? And that I gave to you before time began as your sole possession. When you return it to Me, then will I know you are truly Mine and I will dissolve your sorrow and happiness into Me.\nThat\u2026.being Me, I will place you in bliss forever. for, I love and think of you constantly.\nFrom your most loving Father",

                "description": "Spirituality is meant to be vibrant and full of bubbling joy. Yet, I went through a very difficult period where I felt bored and stagnant. Why does that happen? The answer lies in the answer to these questions which are all connected to the mind. \n1. Why do we remember our 'firsts' in life and not the later similar/same experiences?\n2. Why did Swami insist on His students wearing the white dress?\n3. Why do we feel the need for a Japamala for doing Namasmarana?\n4. Why did Swami insist on 'LOVE' being the ultimate solution? \nand FINALLY,\n5. Why do we do Sadhana? \n\nThe narration includes a couple of experiences including personal ones where we pleaded with Swami to start walking and one where I never ever wanted to go to the Mandir again after 2011. Also included is my technique to ensure my heart is bubbling with love for Swami always.\n\nThis was a talk delivered in the Satsangh hall at Prasanthi Nilayam on the 7th of June 2019.",

The answer lies in the answer to these questions which are all connected to the mind. \n1. Why do we remember our 'firsts' in life and not the later similar/same experiences?\n2. Why did Swami insist on His students wearing the white dress?\n3. Why do we feel the need for a Japamala for doing Namasmarana?\n4. Why did Swami insist on 'LOVE' being the ultimate solution? \nand FINALLY,\n5. Why do we do Sadhana? \n\nThe narration includes a couple of experiences including personal ones where we pleaded with Swami to start walking and one where I never ever wanted to go to the Mandir again after 2011. Also included is my technique to ensure my heart is bubbling with love for Swami always.\n\nThis was a talk delivered in the Satsangh hall at Prasanthi Nilayam on the 7th of June 2019."

The foremost among them is the Truth revealed by Sri Sathya Sai Baba Himself on His identity as Shiva-Shakti. This talk relives the episode from 28th June to 5th July 1963. The other reason is the magnificent Lingodbhava that Swami would perform. What is it's significance? What does it teach us? We learn this through a couple of beautiful personal experiences on Shivarathri.\n\nThis is a talk delivered in the Satsangh Hall in Prasanthi Nilayam on the 9th of February, 2018.",

The foremost among them is the Truth revealed by Sri Sathya Sai Baba Himself on His identity as Shiva-Shakti. This talk relives the episode from 28th June to 5th July 1963. The other reason is the magnificent Lingodbhava that Swami would perform. What is it's significance? What does it teach us? We learn this through a couple of beautiful personal experiences on Shivarathri.\n\nThis is a talk delivered in the Satsangh Hall in Prasanthi Nilayam on the 9th of February, 2018."

One of the lines of that song is \"My Life is My Message; expansion is my life.\"\n\nA proper understanding of this single line is enough to help us understand the secret of life and what we should do with it. Peppered with many direct experiences with Swami, this talk attempts to understand this line from that song. \n\nThis is a talk delivered via Skype for the Zone 6, National Conference in Canary Islands, on the 30th of April 2017.",

One of the lines of that song is \"My Life is My Message; expansion is my life.\"\n\nA proper understanding of this single line is enough to help us understand the secret of life and what we should do with it. Peppered with many direct experiences with Swami, this talk attempts to understand this line from that song. \n\nThis is a talk delivered via Skype for the Zone 6, National Conference in Canary Islands, on the 30th of April 2017."

It was a tremendously momentous day for the alumni of Swami\u2019s Institute working in various capacities at Prasanthi Nilayam and Brindavan. That morning, however, none of them had the slightest inkling of what was in store for them. And today, their dear Master and best friend for life, Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba had decided to confer on them the Secret to Life. This Secret is so profound but so subtle that one often misses it.Swami spoke only one thing - about the ONENESS. He said that there exists nothing else other than God. \n\n\"There is no happiness or sorrow, no victory or defeat, because you are everything. You do not suffer - you are suffering itself. You do not enjoy - you are joy itself.\" It was an exposition on the greatest secret of life and all the details of the session are captured in that article at\n\nhttp://aravindb1982.hubpages.com/hub/Lifes-greatest-secret-What-you-hold-within-is-what-you-get.\n\n After Swami said all that, I decided to seek clarifications for my doubts. Here is the video of the question asked and Swami's answer to the same.\n\nSwami concluded by saying that it was foolish to consider some special things and people as God because everything is God. After a few moments of silence, I asked Swami,\n\n\"Swami, if I consider myself as God, is that not ahamkara ego?\"\n\n\"No. That is not ego at all. That is the correct Truth..... But, if you simply call yourself God and do all mad things, that is not right...\"\n\nEveryone laughed at this point and Swami too laughed. It was so sweet. Swami then lovingly patted me on my head and cheek. Then He said,\n\n\"Think 'I am God' because God is the resident in me. Before you do anything enquire, 'Will God do like this? Chee ... No... But I am doing it!' Search yourself with this Truth. That is the correct way. Whatever work you are doing, do not compartmentalize it like 'worldly work, 'house work', office work' and so on. Office and home are not separate. Everything is one. Who you are is most important. When you realize that, where will the distinction between anything (office and home) remain? Wherever you see, it is only you - nothing else exists (for everything is God and you are also God). Forget everything else and enquire into this \"I\". That is Oneness.\"\n\nThere were no questions to be asked after that. \n\nThe article \"Inconvenient Truth\" is all about this and is at the link below:\n\nhttp://aravindb1982.blogspot.in/2015/06/the-inconvenient-truth-are-we-ready-to-live-by-it.html",

                    "description": "Details of the video: \n\nIt was the 31st of August, 2008. It was a tremendously momentous day for the alumni of Swami\u2019s Institute working in various capacities at Prasanthi Nilayam and Brindavan. That morning, however, none of them had the slightest inkling of what was in store for them. And today, their dear Master and best friend for life, Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba had decided to confer on them the Secret to Life. This Secret is so profound but so subtle that one often misses it.Swami spoke only one thing - about the ONENESS. He said that there exists nothing else other than God. \n\n\"There is no happiness or sorrow, no victory or defeat, because you are everything. You do not suffer - you are suffering itself. You do not enjoy - you are joy itself.\" It was an exposition on the greatest secret of life and all the details of the session are captured in that article at\n\nhttp://aravindb1982.hubpages.com/hub/Lifes-greatest-secret-What-you-hold-within-is-what-you-get.\n\n After Swami said all that, I decided to seek clarifications for my doubts. Here is the video of the question asked and Swami's answer to the same.\n\nSwami concluded by saying that it was foolish to consider some special things and people as God because everything is God.

The direct translation of the discourse is given below.\n\n\"Without having connections of any other sort, members of the Sathya Sai Organisation should be related only through Divine Love - heart to heart. There should be no room for money or power to dictate terms in the Organisation. I do not need temples to be built. I don't need residences. We need not even do yajnas and other rites. Our work should be our (worship) yajna. Our seva should be our rites. So, from now on at least, we should give up this bad quality of trying to collect money for the Organisation in the name of yajnas, worship, construction of temples and other rites. (Applause)\n\nI have told this over and over again - we should not have anything to do with money; it should be with virtues. But even people who occupy positions in the organisation are developing this desire for money.\n\nThere are some people - they misuse Swami's name by saying that Swami entered them, Swami communicates through them and that He has bestowed powers on them - and use that to collect money. There can not be anything more diabolical (rakshasa-like) than this. (Applause)\n\nSwami never enters into such things. I have never done anything like this. But misusing Swami's name like this and entering the crooked path, people are bringing a bad name to Sai. They are converting this into a field of business. But what is the kind of business you should carry out - giving and receiving love. How many ever times I may tell, there are still people who are collecting money in the name of this or that work in the Organisation.\"",
