Her father, Prof. Srinivasan, was appointed by Swami as Professor and Head of the Physics department of the Sathya Sai University and served there from 1983 to 2002. She and her family have received (and continue to receive) innumerable blessings from Bhagawan over the course of their association with Him. Janani studied in the Sri Sathya Sai Higher Secondary School in Puttaparthi from Grade 1 to 12. Post Parthi, she holds a B.sc and an MBA from the Rotman School of Management, Toronto. She used to work for a major Canadian bank. She currently lives with her husband in Princeton, NJ.\n\nPlease tune in live via www.sathyasaitoronto.org/live.",

                    "description": "Om Sri Sai Ram,\n\nPlease join us for Part 4 of our Unity is Divinity Talk Series, as part of the Building Extension and Stupa Project spiritual offering.\n\nThis week's guest speaker is Sister Janani Srinivasan, and the talk is entitled \"E pluribus unum, Out of many, one\". \n\nEven before Janani was as born, Swami made sure he had established himself firmly in the hearts and lives of her family. Her father, Prof. Srinivasan, was appointed by Swami as Professor and Head of the Physics department of the Sathya Sai University and served there from 1983 to 2002. She and her family have received (and continue to receive) innumerable blessings from Bhagawan over the course of their association with Him. Janani studied in the Sri Sathya Sai Higher Secondary School in Puttaparthi from Grade 1 to 12. Post Parthi, she holds a B.sc and an MBA from the Rotman School of Management, Toronto. She used to work for a major Canadian bank. She currently lives with her husband in Princeton, NJ.\n\nPlease tune in live via www.sathyasaitoronto.org/live."

Dedicate all actions to God. That is the way to experience oneness with God. God is in you. You are in God. This oneness is the basic truth.

Against the prevailing nontheistic tides of Buddhism, how does this (especially flawed) Sai Devotee find his way to the reality of divinity?\n\nBrother Imindu serves as an SSE Guru and Education Coordinator at the Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centre of Victoria Park. Among his other work, he researches the inflammation and management of COVID-19 and studies Medicine at the University of Toronto."

Over the past few months, the children have spent time understanding what the Stupa symbolizes and, in the process, have reflected on what Swami says about dharma, religion, and what it is we should focus on. This multimedia offer has been conceptualizing prepared with lots of love by the Group 4 children.

Over the past few months, the children have spent time understanding what the Stupa symbolizes and, in the process, have reflected on what Swami says about dharma, religion, and what it is we should focus on. This multimedia offer has been conceptualizing prepared with lots of love by the Group 4 children. The aim of this offering to provide us all with a deeper understanding of a message that it\u2019s often shared but perhaps not reflected on as often.\n\n\n9:55 AM - Unity is Divinity Talk Series- Part 2 of 5: SSE Presentation\n10:45 AM- Divine Discourse of Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba\n11:00 AM \u2013 Vedam\n11:15 AM \u2013 Bhajans\n12:00 PM \u2013 Aarthi\n12:10 PM - Sai Gayathri (9 times)\n\nThe program concludes at 12:15 PM\n\nsathyasaitoronto.org/live"

Stay on in that thrill of witnessing the light everywhere. If you are adoring God in any form now, try to visualize that form in the all-pervasive light. For Light is God; God is Light.\n\n\"Practice this meditation as I have advised regularly every day. At other times repeat the name of God (any Name fragrant with any of His many Majesties), always taking care to be conscious of His might, mercy, and munificence.\"\n\n- Sri Sathya Sai Baba\nSathya Sai Speaks, Volume X, Page 348-350, Shivarathri, 1979",

                    "description": "\"Since the light illumines all the senses every day so deeply and so systematically, a time will soon come when you can no more relish dark and evil sights, yearn for dark and sinister tales, crave for base, harmful, deadening toxic food and drink, handle dirty demeaning things, approach places of ill-fame and injury, or frame evil designs against anyone at any time. Stay on in that thrill of witnessing the light everywhere. If you are adoring God in any form now, try to visualize that form in the all-pervasive light. For Light is God; God is Light.\n\n\"Practice this meditation as I have advised regularly every day. At other times repeat the name of God (any Name fragrant with any of His many Majesties), always taking care to be conscious of His might, mercy, and munificence.\"\n\n- Sri Sathya Sai Baba\nSathya Sai Speaks, Volume X, Page 348-350, Shivarathri, 1979"

                    "description": "Special Program | Christmas 2020, Dec 24, 2020\n\n'Develop love of God. All other forms of love are not love at all but only fleeting and impermanent attachments. Man's biggest folly is forgetting his Divinity. All should realize that they come from God. All are children of God. Everyone should seek to get nearer and nearer to God. That is spiritual practice (sadana). You must feel that God dwells in your heart ( hridayavasi). You must develop compassion in the heart, because without it, the heart is only a stone.\n\nThat is the message of Jesus: The message of love. Love is God. Live in love. Start the day with love. Spend the day with love. End the day with love. This is the way to God. Only the person who is filled with love will be dear to the Lord.'\n- Divine Discourse: 25 December 1996\n\nJoin us today, for a special Christmas-themed Satsang, including special Adult & SSE offerings, and special multifaith bhajans! Link to our live pages in our bio.\n\nsathyasaitoronto.org/live\nfacebook.com/torontoyorksai/\nmixlr.com/torontoyorksai\ninstagram.com/torontoyorksai"

Man's biggest folly is forgetting his Divinity. All should realize that they come from God. All are children of God. Everyone should seek to get nearer and nearer to God. That is spiritual practice (sadana). You must feel that God dwells in your heart ( hridayavasi). You must develop compassion in the heart, because without it, the heart is only a stone.\n\nThat is the message of Jesus: The message of love. Love is God. Live in love. Start the day with love. Spend the day with love. End the day with love. This is the way to God. Only the person who is filled with love will be dear to the Lord.'\n- Divine Discourse: 25 December 1996\n\nJoin us today, for a special Christmas-themed Satsang, including special Adult & SSE offerings, and special multifaith bhajans!

The theme \"We are His Legacy\" was chosen by the children. The offering has multiple components in the interest of including as many children as possible in various ways.

Acquired happiness is associated with sensory objects; it arises and vanishes according to circumstances. This applies to everyone in the world; what is experienced when things are enjoyed is evanescent. So this type of joy has been described as Acquired or Derived Happiness. As it is got and lost by human effort, it is not true bliss. \n\n\u201cMan, however, seeks lasting bliss (Ananda). In truth he is the embodiment of bliss and is filled with bliss. Bliss constitutes his very nature and being. It exists of itself in him, so why does he not experience it? Being unaware of his true nature, he is obsessed with the external world and fails to experience the bliss within him.\u201d\n\nElaborating on this on February 1, 2001, Baba said:\n\n\u201cBliss is within you; it emanates from your sacred feelings. So you have to manifest bliss from within; it cannot be bestowed on you by others. No one can take the bliss away from you, and you cannot obtain it from outside.\n\n\"With purity of heart, steadiness of mind and selfless actions, one can earn divine grace which can remove any amount of suffering in a trice. Without divine grace, one cannot achieve anything, therefore one must undertake activities that will earn that grace. Peace and happiness cannot be obtained from the external world. Only divine grace can bring you true happiness.\u201d\n\nTime and again through so many of His incarnations, Baba is reminding us of the same principle - All happiness is within and not without. All that is within is eternal while all that is without is ephemeral.\n\nStay connected to our weekly devotional activities with our virtual broadcasts!
